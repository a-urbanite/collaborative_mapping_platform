1) currently the firestore operations are all over the place:

  get all is an API call in getsreversideprops of home
  get by userid is an API call in a useeffect of myPlaces
  upload is in a function in the FireStoreContext

  i need to decide for one approach and implement that consistently

2) marker are uploaded into firestore as one string

  i believe this is suboptimal, firestore seems to provide for real tables so i 
  should be able to upload it as object and firestore then recognises the single sttributes. 
  only this way i can implement serverside functions that allow me to e.g. change the username 
  of markers inside firestore
